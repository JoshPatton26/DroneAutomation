#Drone Automation (Drone Farming)#

This repository is part of a group project for CS420: Software Engineering course at The University of Alabama at Birmingham. My group consists of Eli Davis, Eric Dollar, Kodie Box, Joe Tiller, Josh Patton, John Thompkins, and Jesus Zubia. 

The purpose of this repository is to create a software and application to automate a drone to perform farming tasks. These tasks consist actions such as plating seeds, fertilizing crops, monitoring crops, locate water sources, locate land features, locate hazards, or locate livestock. 

We are using a Telo drone for this project and are writing everything in Java for the software and JavaFX for the application.
